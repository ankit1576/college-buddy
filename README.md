# Project Name

A simple HTML project for creating a personal webpage.

## Overview

This repository provides a basic HTML template for creating a personal webpage. It includes an index.html file that you can customize with your own information.

## Getting Started

To get started with your personalized webpage, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a text editor.

2. Update the image source (img src) with the path to your image. If using an image in the "images" folder, ensure to provide the correct path, e.g., `images/yourname.jpg`.

3. Replace the placeholder email address in the email link with your own email address.

4. If your image is not in the "images" folder, copy it there and ensure it is named appropriately (e.g., `yourname.jpg`).

5. Save the changes to the `index.html` file.

## Usage

After customizing the `index.html` file, open it in a web browser to view your personalized webpage. The webpage will display your image and include a working "Contact Me" link with your email address.

Feel free to further modify the HTML and CSS to meet your preferences.
